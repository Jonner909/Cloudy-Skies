      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>CloudySkies is a real-time air quality monitoring application built to promote environmental awareness. It allows users to search for cities and instantly view their Air Quality Index (AQI), track historical trends, and understand how air pollution fluctuates over time. This tool is especially valuable in encouraging informed decisions about health and outdoor activities based on air quality conditions.</p>

      <h2>Understanding AQI Levels</h2>
      <p>The AQI (Air Quality Index) is a scale used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. AQI values range from 0 to 500, where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>0–50: Good (Green) – Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.</li>
        <li>51–100: Moderate (Yellow) – Acceptable air quality; some pollutants may be a concern for a small number of sensitive individuals.</li>
        <li>101–150: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange)</li>
        <li>151–200: Unhealthy (Red)</li>
        <li>201–300: Very Unhealthy (Purple)</li>
        <li>301–500: Hazardous (Maroon) – Serious health effects for the entire population.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Sources and Reliability</h2>
      <p>CloudySkies uses data provided by the World Air Quality Index (AQICN) platform. This API aggregates information from hundreds of government and private environmental monitoring stations around the world. While data quality depends on each station’s accuracy and update frequency, AQICN provides reliable and timely information widely used in environmental research and public health monitoring.</p>
