# Cloudy-Skies
CloudySkies is a web-based air quality monitoring dashboard designed to inform users about the current air quality in cities around the world. The app fetches real-time data from the AQICN API and presents it through interactive visualizations and location-based filtering. Users can explore historical trends, and understand how air quality changes based on location or time.

The project highlights environmental awareness while demonstrating modern full-stack development with Fetch API, external APIs, Supabase, and deployment on Vercel.
