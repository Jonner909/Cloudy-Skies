# Cloudy-Skies
CloudySkies is a web-based air quality monitoring dashboard designed to inform users about the current air quality in cities around the world. The app fetches real-time data from the AQICN API and presents it through interactive visualizations and location-based filtering. Users can explore air pollution levels by pollutant type (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2), view historical trends, and understand how air quality changes based on location or time.

The project highlights environmental awareness while demonstrating modern full-stack development with Fetch API, external APIs, Supabase, and deployment on Vercel.
